Homework for the eighth lesson

**task0** we created a program to simulate the work of a clinic. We created a class hierarchy. Creacted a abstract class "BaseDoctor" with the fields "department" and "jobTitle". Created one constructor with two parameters. From the class "BaseDoctor" were extended classes "Surgeon", "Dentist" and "Therapist". These classes contain a fields "name" and constructors with three parameters. Classes "Surgeon", "Dentist" and "Therapist" contain method "heal" with parameter "healPlan", but every doctor heals differently. Implemented interface "IHeal" with mandatory method for healing patients. This method is implemented in the created classes "Surgeon", "Dentist" and "Therapist". Also created a class "Patient" with fields "healPlan" and "doctor". Getters and setters are written for these fields. Class "Therapist" contains method who appoint a doctor to a patient according to the heal plan. Operations are performed, object is created, added heal plan for patient, methods are called in the new class "Runner".
